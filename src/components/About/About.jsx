                         <b>Music in India is deeply rooted in tradition, with classical forms 
                            like Hindustani and Carnatic coexisting alongside vibrant regional 
                            folk styles. Bollywood music dominates the mainstream, blending melodies with 
                            storytelling and dance. In recent years, the independent music scene has grown rapidly, 
                            with artists exploring genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic. Punjabi music, in particular, 
                            has witnessed explosive growth, with singers like Karan Aujla gaining international recognition for their lyrical talent and unique style. 
                            The late Sidhu Moosewala played a monumental role in bringing Punjabi music to the global stage, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire millions. 
                            Platforms like NH7 Weekender and Coke Studio have further showcased Indiaâ€™s diverse musical talent worldwide.
